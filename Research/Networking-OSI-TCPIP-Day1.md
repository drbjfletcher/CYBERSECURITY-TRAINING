# Networking Day 1 — OSI / TCP-IP Foundations

## What I Studied Today
- Understanding the OSI model - CompTIA Network+ N10-009-1.1

## 5 Key Takeaways
 1.	There are 7 layers in the OSI model.
	2.	Mnemonics help remember the order:
	•	All People Seem To Need Data Processing
	•	Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
	3.	OSI = Open Systems Interconnection reference model.
	4.	Each layer has specific functions, protocols, and devices.
	5.	Professor Messer is a strong free resource.

## 2 Security Implications
	- Attackers: Knowing layers helps target the right point (ex: Layer 2 spoofing vs Layer 7 web attacks).
	- Defenders: Helps troubleshoot faster and isolate where an intrusion is happening.

## 2 Terms I Now Understand
- MAC Address = Media Access Control address (Layer 2 hardware identifier)
- IP = Internet Protocol (Layer 3 addressing + routing)                                                                                               

## 1 Question I Still Have
- why is github so difficult


Tomorrow (Day 2 Goal)
	•	Learn OSI Layers 1–3 deeper
	•	Understand TCP vs UDP
	•	Commit Day 2 notes cleanly inside /Research
