# Networking Day 2 — TCP vs UDP + Ports

## What I Studied Today
- TCP vs UDP fundamentals
- Ports and common services
- Why protocols matter in cybersecurity

## 5 Key Takeaways
1. TCP is **connection-oriented** (3-way handshake).
2. UDP is **connectionless** (faster, no delivery guarantee).
3. TCP is used when reliability matters (web, email, SSH).
4. UDP is used when speed matters (streaming, DNS, VoIP).
5. Ports identify which service is running on a system.

## 5 Important Ports to Memorize
- 22 = SSH
- 53 = DNS
- 80 = HTTP
- 443 = HTTPS
- 3389 = RDP

## 2 Security Implications
- Attackers scan ports to discover exposed services.
- Defenders close unused ports and monitor traffic patterns.

## 2 Terms I Now Understand Better
- Term 1: Port = a numbered doorway to a network service
- Term 2: Handshake = TCP process to establish a connection

## 1 Question I Still Have
- What tools do professionals use to monitor TCP/UDP traffic live?

## Tomorrow (Day 3 Goal)
- Learn subnetting basics (IP ranges + CIDR)
- Understand private vs public IP addresses
